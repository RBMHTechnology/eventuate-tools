Eventuate Tools
===============

This repository contains tools that support operating 
[Eventuate](https://github.com/RBMHTechnology/eventuate)-based applications.

- [Log Viewer](log-viewer/README.md): A command line tool for viewing the contents 
  of an event log

We plan to add libraries that can be used by Eventuate-based applications to support 
health-monitoring of Eventuate-components as well as offering metrics about Eventuate internals.
